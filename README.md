🚀 User Management System
This User Management System is a full-stack web application built using React.js on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend, with MySQL as the database. It provides robust user registration, login, profile management, and admin functionalities like creating, updating, and deleting users. The system is secured using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for controlled access.

📋 Features
🔐 User Registration and Login
🔑 JWT-based Authentication
🛡️ Role-based Access Control (Admin/User)
👤 Profile Management
👥 Admin User Management
🌐 CORS Configuration
🔒 Password Encryption & Security



🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend:
⚛️ React.js
📡 Axios for API calls
🚦 React Router for routing

Backend:
🌱 Spring Boot
🔐 Spring Security
🛂 JWT for secure authentication
🛢️ MySQL for database
🏗️ Maven for project management

🚀 Installation & Setup
Backend (Spring Boot)
Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link
cd backend

Frontend (React.js)
Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:
cd frontend
npm install



📡 API Endpoints (Backend)
Authentication:
POST /auth/login : User login and JWT generation
POST /auth/register : User registration
User Management:
GET /users : Get a list of all users (Admin)
GET /users/{id} : Get user details by ID
PUT /users/{id} : Update user information
DELETE /users/{id} : Delete a user (Admin)


🔐 Security
BCrypt is used to encrypt user passwords.
JWT tokens are issued after login and are used for authentication of all secured endpoints.
Role-based access control ensures that only admins can perform user management operations.

📝 How to Use
Registration and Login:
Users can register using the registration page.
After registration, they can log in with their credentials.
Upon login, a JWT token is generated and used to authorize further requests.
Admin Panel:
Users with the ADMIN role can access the Admin Dashboard.
The Admin can view, edit, or delete users from the system.
Profile Management:
Logged-in users can update their profile details from the profile page.


🧪 Testing
Frontend Testing:
Use React Developer Tools to test components.
Backend Testing:
Use tools like Postman or cURL to test API endpoints.


🔮 Future Enhancements
Implement pagination for user lists.
Add email verification during registration.
Integrate social login options (Google, Facebook).
